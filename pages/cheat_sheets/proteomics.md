### Description
<!--Write about the domain, its purpose/use, and 2-3 lines on data management challenge when it comes to said domain research in Norway-->
Proteomics is the ‘large scale study of proteins’. Proteins represent the actual functional molecules that regulate the activity and function of cells.  Proteomics enables researchers to analyse the nature and abundance of different proteins within biological samples (e.g. protein complexes, subcellular compartments, whole cells or tissues). Most state of the art proteomics methods are based on high-resolution mass spectrometry instruments with high mass accuracy.

### Storage and Computing
<!--Add information about e.g. NeLS, update this section when SEEK is deployed for NOR-OS metadata?-->
Proteomics data collected in Norway can be analysed by the individual core facilities and stored in [Nels](https://nels.bioinfo.no/pages/user-terms.xhtml), [usegalaxy.no](https://usegalaxy.no) can be used to run [proteomics analysis workflows](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/proteomics/).

### Services in Norway
<!--Add one line description-->
[National network of Advanced Proteomics Infrastructure (NAPI)](https://www.napi.uio.no/) is the research infrastructure for proteomics in Norway.  
NAPI partners include proteomics core facilities in Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, Tromsø and Ås, as well as research groups with a strong focus on proteomics technology development.
Research data is managed at individual sites and coordinated at the research infrastructure level.
