## Optical Light Microscopy
<!--Example: High-Throughput Screening-->


### Description
Light microscopy technologies are widely adopted in modern biological and medical research projects. As the field grows, the number of imaging techniques, processing methods as well as the size of the data increases. To avoid loss or degradation of data in the late stage of a project period and after the end of the project, data management of light microscopy data needs to be considered, planned and executed throughout the data life-cycle.
