### Description

### Type of data/experiments/methods
<!---When mentioning file format, it would be useful to mention format type -->

#### Sequencing data and alignment data
- [FASTQ format](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.r2ts5t)
- [Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) format](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.k97xzh)
- [Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.hza1ec)

#### Variation data
- [Variant Call Format (VCF)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.cfzz0h)

### Metadata Standards
#### [Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.9aa0zp)
The minimum information about any (x) sequence (MIxS) is an overarching framework of sequence metadata
- Ontologies:
  - [Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.1gr4tz)
  - [NCBI Taxonomy (NCBITAXON)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.fj07xj)
  - [Phenotypic QualiTy Ontology (PATO)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.ezwdhz)
  - [Disease Ontology (DOID)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.8b6wfq)
  - [Environment Ontology ENVO)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.azqskx)
  - [Plant Ontology (PO)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.3ngg40)
- Controlled vocabularies:
  - [Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ChEBI)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.62qk8w)

#### [European Variation Archive metadata template](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/files/EVA_Submission_template.V1.1.4.xlsx)
This standard is required for submission of variation data on [EVA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/)

### Sources for Reusable Data
#### [Ensembl](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.fx0mw7)
- Ensembl creates, integrates and distributes reference datasets and analysis tools that enable genomics.
- Data is open-access and can be downloaded free of charge ([disclaimer](https://www.ensembl.org/info/about/legal/index.html))
- Identifiers: [Ensembl stable ID](https://www.ensembl.org/Help/Faq?id=488)
- Free to access, more features with account (username and password)

### Storage and Computing
#### [ELIXIR Norway](https://elixir.no) infrastructures
- [The Norwegian e-infrastructure for Life Sciences (NeLS)](https://nels.bioinfo.no)
  - Free of charge allocation of 1–10 TB disk space
  - Storing active research data for analysing and processing
  - Granular data sharing with collaborators
- [National instance of Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.no/)
  - Provides ~2000 tools data processing and analyses
  - Create, customise and reuse workflows
  - Data stored in NeLS is readily available for processing on Galaxy
    - Data redundancy is avoided
- StoreBioInfo
  - Access through the [NeLS portal]((https://nels.bioinfo.no))
  - Long term (until the end of a project) storage of non-active data
  - Store up to 10 GB of data free of charge

If your data is produced by the [NorSeq core facilities](https://www.norseq.org/),
direct upload to the ELIXIR Norway storage infrastructures is possible. Non-sensitive data
will be uploaded on [NeLS](https://nels.bioinfo.no) following
[these procedures](https://elixir.no/Services-bak/data_produced_NorSeq).
If your data has been produced by another sequence provider,
follow [these instructions](https://elixir.no/Services-bak/non-norseq-data) to request a project on NeLS.
#### [Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/) ([Sikt](https://sikt.no/)) infrastructures
- [High-performance computing](https://www.sigma2.no/high-performance-computing)
  - [Overview](https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/hardware_overview.html) of available machines
- [NIRD data storage](https://www.sigma2.no/data-storage)
  - Storage of active data for processing and analysis
  - Granular data sharing with collaborators
- [NIRD Service Platform](https://www.sigma2.no/nird-service-platform)
  - Run cloud services including tools for processing and visualisation.
  - The services can be used to consume data without moving it from the NIRD storage location.
